# COVID-19 + Weather + SocioHealth in US
This repository contains the code and resources for the project "COVID-19 + Weather + SocioHealth in US". The project focuses on analyzing the impact of COVID-19, weather conditions, and sociohealth factors at the county level in the United States. The dataset used for this project was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnjdavisiv/us-counties-covid19-weather-sociohealth-data.

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to combine county-level data on health, socioeconomics, and weather to identify populations at risk for COVID-19 and help prepare high-risk communities. By conducting Explanatory Data Analysis and creating a comprehensive Tableau dashboard, we aim to provide insights into the relationships between COVID-19 cases, weather conditions, and sociohealth factors.

## Explanatory Data Analysis
Performed an in-depth EDA on the dataset to explore correlations, trends, and patterns between COVID-19 cases, weather variables, and sociohealth indicators. The EDA results are accessible at [EDA.Rmd](EDA.Rmd).

## Tableau Dashboard
Provide a comprehensive visualization of the findings, we have created a Tableau dashboard that combines the county-level data on health, socioeconomics, and weather. The Tableau dashboard can be accessed at [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shafa.amira.qonitatin/viz/USCounties_16862401966560/Dashboard).
